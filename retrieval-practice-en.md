# Retrieval practice

Based on a study by *Jeffrey D. Karpicke* and *Janell R. Blunt*, ["**Retrieval Practice Produces More
Learning than Elaborative Studying
with Concept Mapping**"](https://ctl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/KarpickeBlunt2011.pdf).

In two experiments, they compared the effectiveness of retrieval practice and elaborative studying with concept mapping for producing meaningful
learning of science materials

## Terms

**Retrieval practice** is the act of trying to recall information without having it in front of you.
- **Example:** When students create concept maps in the absence of materials they are learning, then the activity involves practicing retrieval of knowledge

**Elaborative Studying** is the progression from simple to more complex learning, so that subsequent ideas fit into an understood context
- **Example:** When students create concept maps in the presence of materials they are learning, the activity involves elaborative studying.

**Concept Mapping** depicts relationships between concepts and ideas

## Main points
- Practicing retrieval produces greater gains than elaborative studying with concept mapping
- Because each act of retrieval changes memory, the act of reconstructing knowledge must be considered essential to the process of learning.
- Retrieval practice is an effective tool to promote conceptual learning about science
- Retrieval is not merely a readout of the knowledge stored in oneâ€™s mind; the act of reconstructing knowledge itself enhances learning.
- Whether a task is considered `active` is not diagnostic of how much learning the task will produce

## Experiements

### Experiment 1

#### Procedure

The students first studied a science text under one of four conditions within a single initial learning session:
- **study-once** - studied the text in a single study period
- **repeated study** - studied the text in four consecutive study periods
- **elaborative concept mapping** - studied the text in an initial study period and then created a concept map of the concepts in the text
- **retrieval practice** - studied the text in an initial study period and then practiced retrieval by recalling information on a free recall test. After recalling once, the students restudied the text and recalled again

After completing the learning phase, students predicted the percentage of information from the text they would remember in 1 week.

The students then returned to the laboratory 1 week later for a final short-answer test.


#### Result
- The repeated study, elaborative concept mapping, and retrieval practice conditions all **outperformed** the *study-once* condition
- **Retrieval practice produced the best learning**, better than elaborative studying with concept mapping, which itself was not significantly better than spending additional time reading.
- Students predicted that repeated studying would produce the best long term retention and that practicing retrieval would produce the worst retention, **even though the opposite was true**


### Experiment 2

#### Procedure
The second experiment meant to replicate the results of the first experiment and extend them in three ways:
- Generalize results to texts that represent different knowledge structures commonly found in science education. (because under some circumstances the effectiveness of different learning activities can depend on
  the structure of the materials that students are learning)
- Examine the relative effectiveness of retrieval practice and elaborative concept mapping for each individual learner (to determine the robustness of our retrieval practice effects)
- Assess long-term learning with two different final test formats (short-answer test and concept-map test)

#### Result
- Initial level of performance favored the concept mapping condition `concept-map test`
- Retrieval practice produced better performance than elaborative concept mapping for both types of science text `short-answer test`
- Across the two text formats, the advantage of retrieval practice was again large
- Practicing retrieval during original learning produced better performance than engaging in elaborative study by creating concept maps during original learning
- Most students did not expect that retrieval practice would be more effective than elaborative concept mapping, but in fact it was.
